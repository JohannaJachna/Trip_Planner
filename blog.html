        <p class="review1">Yosemite is one of the most scenic parks in all of America. There are so many great hikes and lots of wildlife. I highly recomend Upper Yosemite Falls trail. The view from the top is spectacular. -Hanna J.</p>
        <p class="review2">Yosemite was absolutely amazing! The air was so fresh and the sky was the brightest blue. The scenery was breathtaking and the views were the most majestic views I've ever seen. I definitley hope to return in the future. - Emily H.</p>
